Having used Unix, Solaris, OS/2, and Linux (Slackware) in the early 1990's for both work and personal needs, I mostly used DOS and Windows systems. Ultimately, I became a Windows only user and remained so for many years. Now I am turning my attention back to Linux, Ubuntu specifically, for my home PC use.
